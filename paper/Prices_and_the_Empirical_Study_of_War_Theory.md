What can prices from financial markets tell us about war?

- Prices can be used in two ways to make inferences about war: indierect and direct

    * indirect: The market as an observer, and not a player in the game.  The prices are a proxy for a prediction market.
    * direct: The market as a player in a game. Prices the market sets affects the actions of the belligerents.

- Prices provide an estimate of the "informational content" of events (relative to the counterfactual).
  Since at least one of the major mechanisms of conflict (private information) is explicitly about the information that battles can reveal this seems a promising avenue.
- Explanation of what prices are measuring
- Prices as causal inference and comparison to counterfactual
- Prices as measuring informational advantage
- Pros

    - Concern about the biases of historical sources: hindsight bias, 
	- Proxy for an expectation based off of public information.
    - By making inferences against a counterfactual allows for quantitative analysis of single cases. This is important because intra-war data is still relatively scarce.
    - If wars are sufficiently heterogenous, the counterfactual estimate of the market may be better than the implicit counterfactual estimate formed from other cases.
- Problems

    - mapping between prices and outcomes of interest may be unclear.
	- the counterfactual is not always clear.
