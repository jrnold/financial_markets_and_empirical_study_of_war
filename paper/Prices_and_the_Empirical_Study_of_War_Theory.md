What can prices from financial markets tell us about war?

- Prices can be used in two ways to make inferences about war: indirect and direct

    * indirect: The market as an observer, and not a player in the game.  The prices are a proxy for a prediction market.
    * direct: The market as a player in a game. Prices the market sets affects the actions of the belligerents.

- Prices provide an estimate of the "informational content" of events (relative to the counterfactual).
  Since at least one of the major mechanisms of conflict (private information) is explicitly about the information that battles can reveal this seems a promising avenue.
- Explanation of what prices are measuring
- Prices as causal inference and comparison to counterfactual
- Prices as measuring informational advantage
- Pros

    - Concern about the biases of historical sources: hindsight bias, 
	- Proxy for an expectation based off of public information.
    - By making inferences against a counterfactual allows for quantitative analysis of single cases. This is important because intra-war data is still relatively scarce.
    - If wars are sufficiently heterogenous, the counterfactual estimate of the market may be better than the implicit counterfactual estimate formed from other cases.
- Problems

    - mapping between prices and outcomes of interest may be unclear.
	- the counterfactual is not always clear.

# Prices

A simple of model of a price of a financial asset is @GuidolinLaFerrara2010

$$
P_t = \sum_{j = 1}^{H} \frac{E(C_{t + j} | \mathcal{I}_t)}{\prod_{j = 1}^{H} (1 + r^f + E(\pi_{t + j} | \mathcal{I}_t)}
$$
A similar analysis holds for interest rates; the current interest rate is a function of the market's beliefs.

Thus events, which change in the information set (news), can cause a changes in prices.
More importantly, after accounting for some deterministic changes in payoffs like coupons, changes in prices must be due to the change in the information set.
A change in price has a natural causal interpretation; it is approximately the change in the expected payoff relative to the counterfactual of no new news.
Thus events in the world influence prices through their changes on the expected future cashflows.

A change in prices has a causal interpretation.
It is the change in the expected payoff to an investor relative to the counterfactual of the new information not arriving, once any non-informational changes have been accounted for (e.g. coupon or derivative payments). 

Conversely, if other events can be controlled for, changes in prices can be used to infer the new information present in an event.

First, what is the relationship between prices and the outcome of interest.
In general, prices will be related to both war outcomes and war costs to each party.

This may make it difficulty to disentangle these two effects. 
On one hand this is useful in the sense that the "outcome" of the war is an expected utility, albeit to the market rather than the belligerents directly, although they are related.

However, multiple prices, or particular assets may allow the researcher to differentiate these effects.
Prior knowledge of the case can be used to differentiate. In the case of civil wars with assets issued by the rebelling side, the outcome of the war may dominate the price of the asset so that.

The best case is to use particular prediction markets, or even betting lines on these events.

Pre war events?

Within war events?

Effect on the price (through the war outcome) conditional on the ex ante expectations of a battle and its outcome.
This means that battles that are unexpected, and outcomes of battles that are unexpected can have the most information.

However, not fighting when it expected can also have an effect.

But what is the relationship between the realization of a battle and its

1. Learning about the parameters of the war process.
2. Changing the war process.


Difficulties:

- What are events? 


- What is expected?
