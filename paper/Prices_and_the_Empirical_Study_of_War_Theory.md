## Financial Markets and the Study of War

Financial markets play two roles: 

- Market as Observer, e.g. prediction market
- Market as Actor, e.g. financier

# What are financial markets

  - Asset prices are expectations about the future
  - Changes in asset prices have this causal interpretation - effect of event relative to counterfactual of what would have happened otherwise. Prior probability of the event is already priced in, so its causal effect is there.
  - Informational content

- Meaning of this? 

  - Predictions as proxies for the truth

    - efficient.
	- efficient markets are good estimates of future prices, not necessarily the truth
	- small n, heterogenous wars
	- already the sort of informal historical research

  - Interest in itself

    - estimate of E(y | current beliefs)
    - if it is a player ...

- General thoughts about forecasting and determining commitment problems and informational problems

  - Bayesian convergence - 1 over n. What do we learn? Dependent on prior, dependent on what counts as observation, ... dependent on posterior. 
  - What if moving state space?
  - How to determine what is a reasonable forecast and prediction?


What can prices from financial markets tell us about war?

- Prices can be used in two ways to make inferences about war: indirect and direct

    * indirect: The market as an observer, and not a player in the game.  The prices are a proxy for a prediction market.
    * direct: The market as a player in a game. Prices the market sets affects the actions of the belligerents.

- Prices provide an estimate of the "informational content" of events (relative to the counterfactual).
  Since at least one of the major mechanisms of conflict (private information) is explicitly about the information that battles can reveal this seems a promising avenue.
- Explanation of what prices are measuring
- Prices as causal inference and comparison to counterfactual
- Prices as measuring informational advantage
- Pros

    - Concern about the biases of historical sources: hindsight bias, 
	- Proxy for an expectation based off of public information.
    - By making inferences against a counterfactual allows for quantitative analysis of single cases. This is important because intra-war data is still relatively scarce.
    - If wars are sufficiently heterogenous, the counterfactual estimate of the market may be better than the implicit counterfactual estimate formed from other cases.
- Problems

    - mapping between prices and outcomes of interest may be unclear.
	- the counterfactual is not always clear.

# Prices

Advantages of prices for study of war (cite Willard, Fey, and Weidermeier):

- It is not subject to hindsight bias. As long as the data is not ex post manipulated, the prices at a given time are not subject to hindsight bias.
- Market participants are making costly bets on the future, and thus have incentives to behave truthfully. This is in contrast to things written by actors, which may have incentives to lie, either at the time, or later, in order to justify their actions.
- Market participants are making costly bets on the future, and thus have incentives to be well informed. This is in contrast to opinion polls, in which the respondents have little incentive to be informed.
- As a numerical indicator, it may be less subject to subjective interpretation error than using texts.
  This advantage is not entirely clear because although the value of the price is clear, excepting some measurement error with missing values and bid-ask spreads, the precise relationship between the price of that asset and the concept of interest to a political science researcher of war, e.g. the outcome or cost of the war, is not clear.

However, there are certainly cases in which the market may not provide a good proxy:

- Markets may be illiquid
- Markets may be subject to manipulation
- Market behavior may not 
- Prices are conditional on the beliefs of the markets, and there is no guarantee that those beliefs are unbiased.  However, if the researcher is interested in a measure based on public knowledge of a time period, the markets' may serve as a good proxy. By merely being contemporaries, the biases of the markets' beliefs are likely correlated with those of decisionmakers or the publics'

A simple of model of a price of a financial asset is @GuidolinLaFerrara2010

$$
P_t = \sum_{j = 1}^{H} \frac{E(C_{t + j} | \mathcal{I}_t)}{\prod_{j = 1}^{H} (1 + r^f + E(\pi_{t + j} | \mathcal{I}_t)}
$$
A similar analysis holds for interest rates; the current interest rate is a function of the market's beliefs.

So if beliefs of the market are good / unbiased, then this maybe a way to estimate the effect of events / battles.
If they are not, and good reason to believe it, what does it mean?
It is probably a good estimate of the public information set?

If markets are not well integrated, or there is a lag in integration, and prices diverge, it may be an indicator of different belief sets, and thus the possible presence of private information.
However, those differences may also be due to differences in market structure, with transaction costs preventing arbitrage.

Thus events, which change in the information set (news), can cause a changes in prices.
More importantly, after accounting for some deterministic changes in payoffs like coupons, changes in prices must be due to the change in the information set.
A change in price has a natural causal interpretatio;n it is approximately the change in the expected payoff relative to the counterfactual of no new news.
Thus events in the world influence prices through their changes on the expected future cashflows.

What is interesting from a research perspective, is that a change in prices has a sort of causal interpretation.
$$
\Delta P_t = \sum_{j = 1}^{H} \frac{E(C_{t + j} | \mathcal{I}_t)}{\prod_{j = 1}^{H} (1 + r^f + E(\pi_{t + j} | \mathcal{I}_t)}
$$
It is the change in the expected payoff to an investor relative to the counterfactual of the new information not arriving, once any non-informational changes have been accounted for (e.g. coupon or derivative payments). 

Conversely, if other events can be controlled for, changes in prices can be used to infer the new information present in an event.

First, what is the relationship between prices and the outcome of interest.
In general, prices will be related to both war outcomes and war costs to each party.

This may make it difficulty to disentangle these two effects. 
On one hand this is useful in the sense that the "outcome" of the war is an expected utility, albeit to the market rather than the belligerents directly, although they are related.

However, multiple prices, or particular assets may allow the researcher to differentiate these effects.
Prior knowledge of the case can be used to differentiate. In the case of civil wars with assets issued by the rebelling side, the outcome of the war may dominate the price of the asset so that.

The best case is to use particular prediction markets, or even betting lines on these events.

Pre war events?

Within war events?

Effect on the price (through the war outcome) conditional on the ex ante expectations of a battle and its outcome.
This means that battles that are unexpected, and outcomes of battles that are unexpected can have the most information.

However, not fighting when it expected can also have an effect.

But what is the relationship between the realization of a battle and its

1. Learning about the parameters of the war process.
2. Changing the war process.

Difficulties:

- What are events? 

- What is expected?

Information


Uncertainty

- Revealed Volatility
- Implied volatility
- Auction Prices

# The Market as an Actor?

What is the equilibrium response of the market? b/c market should anticipate the reaction to higher prices?

- Slantchev has a market with an endogenous interest rate, but not a signaling game.
- Gartzke, Boehmer and Li have not market, only a mutual benefit.
- Gartkze "Capitalist Peace" is not a bargaining framework, and has no formal model. What is the endogenous rate at which the market sets its price?
- Can the market signal conflict without private information? 

# Forecasting Combat

What is the model?

Updating data and Bayesian convergence?
Show example from the American Civil War. Dependent on prior.

DLM Convergence proof? If dependent on a latent state, may learn the parts of the prior, but not the current state.

How to measure surprise?

Need to consider forecasting. Flexible. Use similar sorts of modeling approaches, out of sample forecasts.
